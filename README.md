House Price Analysis
This repository contains a data analysis project that investigates how various factors influence house prices. Using a dataset of house attributes, we aim to uncover trends, correlations, and insights that help understand what drives property value.
Project Overview
The analysis leverages Python to explore relationships between house prices (SalePrice) and features such as:

Property type (MSSubClass, BldgType).
Location attributes (MSZoning, LotConfig).
Structural attributes (YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd, Exterior1st).
Size and condition metrics (LotArea, OverallCond, TotalBsmtSF, BsmtFinSF2).
Key steps include:

Data cleaning and preprocessing.
Visualizing distributions and correlations.
Examining categorical and numerical impacts on SalePrice.



Features Explored
Numerical Features:

LotArea: Total lot size.
OverallCond: Overall condition rating (1–10).
YearBuilt and YearRemodAdd: Construction and remodeling years.
BsmtFinSF2 and TotalBsmtSF: Basement areas in square feet.
Categorical Features:

MSSubClass: Type of dwelling.
MSZoning: Zoning classification (e.g., Residential, Commercial).
LotConfig: Lot configuration (e.g., Corner lot, Cul-de-sac).
BldgType: Type of building structure.
Exterior1st: Primary exterior material.

Features Explored
Numerical Features:

LotArea: Total lot size.
OverallCond: Overall condition rating (1–10).
YearBuilt and YearRemodAdd: Construction and remodeling years.
BsmtFinSF2 and TotalBsmtSF: Basement areas in square feet.
Categorical Features:

Insights
Strong Correlations: Certain numerical features like TotalBsmtSF and YearBuilt show strong relationships with SalePrice.
Categorical Impacts: Zoning (MSZoning) and building type (BldgType) significantly affect house prices.
Outliers and Trends: Distribution plots reveal skewness in house prices and highlight potential outliers.


Visualizations
This analysis includes:

Heatmaps for correlation analysis.
Boxplots for categorical feature impacts.
Scatter plots to explore trends with time and area.
Distribution plots for SalePrice and numerical features.
